# Movie-Recommendation-and-Data-Analysis-System
#Introduction
Movies hold universal appeal, connecting people of all backgrounds. Despite this unity, individual movie preferences remain distinct, ranging from specific genres like thrillers, romance, or sci-fi to focusing on favorite actors and directors. As data scientists, we can analyze behavioral patterns to identify groups of similar movie preferences in society and develop a Movie Recommendation System.

# Learning Outcomes
Gain a comprehensive understanding of recommendation algorithms, their purpose, and how they function to predict user preferences.
Learn why recommendation engines enhance user experience, increase engagement, and drive revenue in various platforms.
Explore different recommendation engine types, specifically content-based and collaborative filtering, including their methods, advantages, and limitations.
Acquire practical knowledge of implementing a movie recommendation system using Python.
Understand the application of machine learning models and algorithms to build a recommendation engine.
Recommendation Strategies
#1. Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering suggests items similar to those a user has previously liked. It calculates similarity (often using cosine similarity) between the userâ€™s preferences and item attributes, such as lead actors, directors, and genres1. In n-dimensional space, cosine similarity quantifies the angle between two vectors.

# 2. Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering analyzes user-item interactions to make recommendations. It can be further divided into two subtypes:

1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to those a user has already liked.
Getting Started
3. Data Collection: Gather movie data, including attributes like genre, cast, and director.
4. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the data into a usable format.
5. Feature Extraction: Create feature vectors for movies (e.g., using TF-IDF for text-based features).
6. Cosine Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors.
7. Recommendation Generation: Based on user preferences and similarity scores, recommend movies.
